"""AngeVoice — lightweight Chinese TTS service built on Kokoro v1.1.

The import package intentionally remains ``kokoro_tts`` for backward
compatibility with earlier releases. The distribution name and recommended CLI
are now ``angevoice``; the historical ``kokoro-tts`` command is kept as an alias.

Usage:
    from kokoro_tts import TTSEngine
    engine = TTSEngine()
    engine.load()
    wav_bytes = engine.synthesize("你好世界")

    angevoice serve
    angevoice synth "你好" -o out.wav
    angevoice voices
