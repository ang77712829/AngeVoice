# AngeVoice

> Lightweight Chinese TTS self-hosted service. AngeVoice defaults to Kokoro v1.1 Chinese and can switch to MOSS-TTS-Nano on demand. It provides an OpenAI-compatible API, WebSocket streaming, Studio Web UI, MOSS reference-audio cloning, batch synthesis, cache, metrics, and Docker CPU/GPU/legacy-GPU profiles.

## One-command install (recommended)

After Docker and Docker Compose V2 are installed, run the interactive installer. It detects CPU/GPU, older NVIDIA cards, Docker/Compose and GitHub/GHCR connectivity, then recommends the `cpu`, `gpu` or `legacy-gpu` profile.

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ang77712829/AngeVoice/main/scripts/install.sh)
```

For restricted networks, clone the repository first and run the local installer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ang77712829/AngeVoice.git
cd AngeVoice
bash scripts/install.sh
```

Shared Docker defaults live in `docker/angevoice.env`. They are CPU/NAS-safe by default; GPU profiles only override the required CUDA settings.

## What is AngeVoice?

AngeVoice is not a newly trained model. It is a local TTS service framework for low-power devices, NAS boxes, and long-running self-hosted environments.

Good fits:

- Local/NAS/home-server Chinese speech synthesis
- TTS backend for agents, readers, audiobooks, and dubbing tools
- OpenAI-compatible TTS API backend
- Web apps that need segment playback, stop generation, and batch ZIP export
- CPU, NVIDIA GPU, and legacy/conservative CUDA environments

> Model source: the default engine is built on Kokoro v1.1 / Kokoro-82M Chinese. MOSS-TTS-Nano integration uses the official OpenMOSS runtime code. Model copyright, license, and restrictions follow upstream repositories.

## Highlights

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| Studio Web UI | Built-in console with model switching, voice filtering, preview, streaming playback, stop generation, API-key settings, and metrics |
| API docs page | `GET /api-docs` provides copyable examples, especially for MOSS reference-audio clone and streaming clone |
| OpenAI-compatible API | `POST /v1/audio/speech` with `model/input/voice/speed/response_format` |
| MOSS-TTS-Nano | OpenMOSS ONNX runtime adapter with preset voices, reference-audio cloning, CPU baseline, and experimental CUDA mode; CUDA uses process isolation by default so a stuck worker can be killed |
| Multi-model runtime | `/v1/models` lists, loads, unloads, and switches engines; cache keys are isolated by model |
| WebSocket streaming | `WS /ws/v1/tts`; bounded chunks, `cancel` / `stop`, MOSS clone audio in the first JSON message |
| Chinese text rules | Auto pause punctuation, jieba-first segmentation, fallback lexicon, and common polyphone overrides |
| Batch synthesis | `POST /v1/audio/batch` returns a ZIP and `manifest.json` |
| Service controls | Request IDs, `/health`, `/stats`, `/requests`, timeout, concurrency guard, LRU cache |
| Docker profiles | CPU, GPU, and Legacy GPU Compose profiles |
| CLI | Recommended command: `angevoice`; legacy `kokoro-tts` remains supported |
| Idle timeout release | Defaults to unloading all loaded models after 10 minutes of inactivity, including the current model, to reduce NAS power/VRAM usage |

## Quick start

### Docker GPU

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ang77712829/AngeVoice.git
cd AngeVoice/docker/gpu
sudo docker compose up -d
```

Default URL:

```text
http://localhost:8101
```

Check the service:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8101/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:8101/v1/models
```

> **Container health status**: Every Docker image includes a built-in `HEALTHCHECK` that hits `/health` every 30 seconds. A `{"status":"ok"}` or `{"status":"idle"}` response marks the container as **healthy**. `idle` means the current model was unloaded by the idle timer but the service is ready to auto-load it on the next request. The 60-second start period allows model loading before the first check. Inspect with `docker inspect --format='{{json .State.Health}}' <container>`.

### Docker CPU / Legacy GPU

```bash
# CPU, default port 8100
cd docker/cpu && sudo docker compose up -d

# Legacy GPU, default port 8102
cd docker/legacy-gpu && sudo docker compose up -d
```

### Editable pip install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ang77712829/AngeVoice.git
cd AngeVoice
pip install -e .

angevoice serve --port 8000
angevoice synth "Hello world" -o hello.wav -v zm_010

# Legacy command still works
kokoro-tts serve --port 8000
```


### `/health` status semantics

| status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ok` | Service is healthy and the current model is loaded |
| `idle` | Service is healthy, but the current model was unloaded by the idle timer and will auto-load on next request |
| `loading` | Service is up but the current model is still loading or has not completed first load |
| `degraded` | At least one loaded model is unhealthy |

Docker health checks treat both `ok` and `idle` as healthy.

| Capability | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Health / metrics / requests | `GET /health`, `GET /stats`, `GET /requests` |
| Model list / current / switch | `GET /v1/models`, `GET /v1/models/current`, `POST /v1/models/switch` |
| Voices / formats | `GET /v1/audio/voices`, `GET /v1/audio/formats` |

## Common API examples

### OpenAI-compatible TTS

```bash
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000

curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/v1/audio/speech" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"kokoro","input":"Hello world","voice":"zm_010","response_format":"wav"}' \
  --output output.wav
```

When `KOKORO_API_KEY` is enabled, add:

```bash
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### MOSS reference-audio clone

MOSS clone does **not** use `models/voices`. That directory is for Kokoro `.pt` voices.

The recommended path is uploading the reference audio with the request:

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/api/tts" \
  -F model=moss-nano-cpu \
  -F text="This is a reference-audio clone test." \
  -F voice=Junhao \
  -F response_format=wav \
  -F prompt_audio=@reference.wav \
  --output clone.wav
```

WebSocket streaming clone carries reference audio in the first JSON message:

```json
{
  "model": "moss-nano-cpu",
  "text": "This is a streamed reference-audio clone test.",
  "voice": "Junhao",
  "format": "pcm_s16le",
  "prompt_audio": {
    "filename": "reference.wav",
    "data": "<base64-or-data-url>"
  }
}
```

- [`docs/API_REFERENCE.md`](docs/API_REFERENCE.md)

## Model files

If local model files are not found, the service falls back to Hugging Face download. For offline deployments or faster cold starts:

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
huggingface-cli download hexgrad/Kokoro-82M-v1.1-zh \
  --local-dir models/ \
  --include "config.json" "kokoro-v1_1-zh.pth" "voices/*.pt"
```

Required layout:

```text
models/config.json
models/kokoro-v1_1-zh.pth
models/voices/*.pt
```

A normal `git clone` may only download Git LFS pointer files. Docker Compose profiles persist the Hugging Face cache to avoid repeated downloads after container recreation.

## Docker persistence

| Host path | Container path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `../../hf_cache` | `/root/.cache/huggingface` | Kokoro/Hugging Face cache |
| `../../moss_models` | `/opt/MOSS-TTS-Nano/models` | MOSS ONNX asset cache |
| `../../outputs` | `/app/outputs` | HTTP synthesis outputs when `ANGEVOICE_SAVE_OUTPUTS=true` |

To set a server-side default MOSS reference audio:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ../../prompts:/app/prompts:ro

environment:
  - MOSS_PROMPT_AUDIO_PATH=/app/prompts/reference.wav
```

## Security notes

- Set `KOKORO_API_KEY` for public or semi-public deployments.
- Admin UI/APIs are disabled by default. If enabled, `ANGEVOICE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is required; public deployments should also set `KOKORO_API_KEY` and restrict access at the reverse proxy.
- `.pt` voice upload is disabled by default. Only upload trusted files.

⚠️ **Security Warning**: Enabling `KOKORO_VOICE_UPLOAD_ENABLED` on public-facing servers is **strongly discouraged**.
Only upload `.pt` files you generated yourself or from fully trusted sources.
If upload must be enabled, restrict to internal network admin endpoints with reverse-proxy IP whitelisting.
`.pt` files use PyTorch serialization which can theoretically execute arbitrary code.
- Do not expose `/admin/*` directly to the public internet.

See [`docs/SECURITY.md`](docs/SECURITY.md).

## Known limitations

- AngeVoice does not train a new model; quality, license, and language capability follow upstream models.
- `moss-nano-cuda` is experimental. Test on the target host before long-running service.
- Long-form text is synthesized segment by segment. Very long books should use a batch/task workflow.
- For GPU deployments, avoid multiple workers loading the model at the same time unless you have enough VRAM.
- MP3 output depends on ffmpeg.
- WebSocket streaming sends bounded audio chunks, not token-level speech generation.

## Testing

```bash
pip install -e '.[dev]'
pytest -q --cov=kokoro_tts --cov-report=term-missing
```

End-to-end testing (requires a running service):

```bash
# Full E2E loop test: health / voices / synthesis / websocket / cancel / idle unload / stress
chmod +x scripts/e2e_loop_test.sh
./scripts/e2e_loop_test.sh http://127.0.0.1:8101              # no auth, 10 loops
./scripts/e2e_loop_test.sh http://127.0.0.1:8101 my-key 50    # with auth, 50 loops
```

Lightweight smoke tests:

You can also manually trigger the `Docker CPU Smoke` GitHub Actions workflow to validate `docker compose config --quiet`, CPU image build, container startup, `/health`, and `scripts/smoke_test.sh`.

```bash
chmod +x scripts/smoke_test.sh scripts/loop_test.sh
BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8101 ./scripts/smoke_test.sh
N=50 BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8101 ./scripts/loop_test.sh
```
