# AngeVoice

> Lightweight Chinese TTS self-hosted service. AngeVoice defaults to Kokoro v1.1 Chinese and can switch to MOSS-TTS-Nano on demand. It provides an OpenAI-compatible API, WebSocket streaming, Studio Web UI, in-browser recording, generic voice-profile/reference-audio management, batch synthesis, cache, metrics, and Docker CPU/GPU/legacy-GPU deployments.

## One-command install (recommended)

After Docker and Docker Compose V2 are installed, run the interactive installer. It detects CPU/GPU, Docker/Compose, GitHub, Docker Hub, and local Docker registry mirrors. When an NVIDIA GPU is found, it recommends the standard `gpu` profile first; `legacy-gpu` is a compatibility profile for hosts where `gpu` cannot start or CUDA/cuDNN is incompatible.

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ang77712829/AngeVoice/main/scripts/install.sh)
```

For restricted networks, clone the repository first and run the local installer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ang77712829/AngeVoice.git
cd AngeVoice
bash scripts/install.sh
```

Shared Docker defaults live in `docker/angevoice.env`. The protected admin UI is enabled by default and new deployments can enter with `admin / admin123`; the security panel prominently requires changing those credentials before public exposure, and changed passwords are stored only as hashes. The standard `gpu` profile is the recommended NVIDIA path; `legacy-gpu` is a compatibility profile.

When the script is run from an existing source checkout, it installs/updates **in place** and no longer clones another copy into `/opt/angevoice`, which is friendlier for NAS file managers. The `/opt/angevoice` fallback is only used for remote `curl` installs where no local project directory exists. After startup, the script prints the detected LAN URL, for example `http://192.168.1.10:8101`.

After installation, the script creates the `AngeVoice` management command. Run:

```bash
AngeVoice
```

It opens a menu for install/update, restart, stop, uninstall, status and access URLs. Direct commands are also available:

```bash
bash scripts/install.sh --status
bash scripts/install.sh --restart
bash scripts/install.sh --stop
bash scripts/install.sh --uninstall
```

Uninstall stops/removes containers and networks only; models, outputs and config files are kept.


## Xiaozhi ESP32 server adapter

This repository now includes a non-invasive `xiaozhi/` adapter kit for xiaozhi-esp32-server:

- `xiaozhi/adapters/angevoice.py`: non-streaming OpenAI-compatible TTS adapter.
- `xiaozhi/adapters/angevoice_stream.py`: WebSocket streaming adapter for Kokoro/MOSS.
- `xiaozhi/adapters/angevoice_clone.py`: non-streaming MOSS reference-audio clone adapter.
- `xiaozhi/scripts/install-xiaozhi-adapter.sh`: one-command installer for adapter files, Compose patching and example config.
- `xiaozhi/manager/presets.yaml`: copyable console presets; it does not modify xiaozhi frontend code.

Quick install from a xiaozhi server directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/xiaozhi-server
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ang77712829/AngeVoice/main/xiaozhi/scripts/install-xiaozhi-adapter.sh)
```

See [`xiaozhi/README.md`](xiaozhi/README.md) for the full Chinese guide.

## What is AngeVoice?

AngeVoice is not a newly trained model. It is a local TTS service framework for low-power devices, NAS boxes, and long-running self-hosted environments.

Good fits:

- Local/NAS/home-server Chinese speech synthesis
- TTS backend for agents, readers, audiobooks, and dubbing tools
- OpenAI-compatible TTS API backend
- Web apps that need segment playback, stop generation, and batch ZIP export
- CPU, NVIDIA GPU, and legacy/conservative CUDA environments

> Core upstream projects: the default engine is built on Kokoro v1.1 / Kokoro-82M Chinese; MOSS-TTS-Nano uses the official OpenMOSS runtime; ZipVoice provides zero-shot voice cloning. All three core upstream projects use the Apache License 2.0; see `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and `ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md` for attribution.

## Highlights

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| Studio Web UI | Built-in console with model switching, browser recording/reference upload, Voice Profile save/preview/delete, streaming playback, stop generation, API-key settings, and metrics |
| API docs page | `GET /api-docs` provides copyable examples, especially for MOSS reference-audio clone and streaming clone |
| OpenAI-compatible API | `POST /v1/audio/speech` with `model/input/voice/speed/response_format` |
| MOSS-TTS-Nano | OpenMOSS ONNX runtime adapter with preset voices and reference-audio cloning; the stable product name is independent of the actual CPU/CUDA provider reported by diagnostics |
| Multi-model runtime | `/v1/models` lists, loads, unloads, and switches engines; cache keys are isolated by model |
| TTS capabilities | `GET /v1/tts/capabilities` returns current model capabilities, available encodings, and voice details |
| WebSocket streaming | `WS /ws/v1/tts`; bounded chunks, `cancel` / `stop`, MOSS clone audio in the first JSON message |
| Chinese text rules | Auto pause punctuation, jieba-first segmentation, fallback lexicon, and common polyphone overrides |
| Batch synthesis | `POST /v1/audio/batch` returns a ZIP and `manifest.json` |
| Service controls | Request IDs, `/health`, `/stats`, `/requests`, timeout, concurrency guard, LRU cache |
| Docker profiles | CPU, GPU, and Legacy GPU Compose profiles |
| CLI | `kokoro-tts serve`（also supports `python -m kokoro_tts.main serve`） |
| Idle resource release | Defaults to unloading all loaded models after 10 minutes of inactivity; an optional admin switch can exit after idle unload so Docker/service managers restart the container and reclaim low-level runtime leftovers |

## Quick start

### Docker GPU

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ang77712829/AngeVoice.git
cd AngeVoice/docker/gpu
sudo docker compose up -d
```

Default URL:

```text
http://localhost:8101
```

Check the service:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8101/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:8101/v1/models
```

> **Container health status**: Every Docker image includes a built-in `HEALTHCHECK` that hits `/health` every 30 seconds. A `{"status":"ok"}` or `{"status":"idle"}` response marks the container as **healthy**. `idle` means the current model was unloaded by the idle timer but the service is ready to auto-load it on the next request. The 60-second start period allows model loading before the first check. Inspect with `docker inspect --format='{{json .State.Health}}' <container>`.

### Docker CPU / legacy-gpu fallback

```bash
# CPU, default port 8100
cd docker/cpu && sudo docker compose up -d

# legacy-gpu, default port 8102
# Use only when docker/gpu cannot start or CUDA/cuDNN is incompatible.
cd docker/legacy-gpu && sudo docker compose up -d
```

> Try `docker/gpu` first on NVIDIA hosts. `legacy-gpu` is a compatibility fallback for older drivers or CUDA/cuDNN combinations that cannot run the standard GPU image.


### China Mirror Acceleration

Docker Compose pulls the current versioned Docker Hub images (`maxblack777/angevoice-*:v2.6.615`) by default. If Docker Hub is slow from mainland China, use a Docker mirror proxy:

```bash
# Option 1: Pull via mirror, then retag
docker pull docker.1ms.run/maxblack777/angevoice-gpu:v2.6.615
docker tag docker.1ms.run/maxblack777/angevoice-gpu:v2.6.615 maxblack777/angevoice-gpu:v2.6.615

# Option 2: Configure Docker daemon global mirror (recommended)
# Edit /etc/docker/daemon.json and add:
# { "registry-mirrors": ["https://docker.1ms.run"] }
# Then restart Docker: sudo systemctl restart docker
```

> Common mirrors: `docker.1ms.run`, `docker.xuanyuan.me`, `dockerpull.org`. Mirror availability may vary; try an alternative if one is down.




### `/health` status semantics

| status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ok` | Service is healthy and the current model is loaded |
| `idle` | Service is healthy, but the current model was unloaded by the idle timer and will auto-load on next request |
| `loading` | Service is up but the current model is still loading or has not completed first load |
| `degraded` | At least one loaded model is unhealthy |

Docker health checks treat both `ok` and `idle` as healthy.

## Ports and endpoint overview

| Profile | HTTP / Web UI | WebSocket |
|---|---|---|
| Docker CPU | `http://localhost:8100` | `ws://localhost:8100/ws/v1/tts` |
| Docker GPU | `http://localhost:8101` | `ws://localhost:8101/ws/v1/tts` |
| Docker Legacy GPU | `http://localhost:8102` | `ws://localhost:8102/ws/v1/tts` |

| Capability | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Health / metrics / requests | `GET /health`, `GET /stats`, `GET /requests` |
| Model list / current / switch | `GET /v1/models`, `GET /v1/models/current`, `POST /v1/models/switch` |
| Voices / formats | `GET /v1/audio/voices` (supports `?detail=true` for gender/display name), `GET /v1/audio/formats` |
| TTS capabilities | `GET /v1/tts/capabilities` |
| OpenAI-compatible speech | `POST /v1/audio/speech` |
| Legacy speech / MOSS clone upload | `GET /api/tts`, `POST /api/tts` |
| WebSocket streaming / MOSS clone streaming | `WS /ws/v1/tts` |
| Batch ZIP | `POST /v1/audio/batch` |
| Cancel request | `POST /v1/audio/requests/{request_id}/cancel` |

## Common API examples

### OpenAI-compatible TTS

```bash
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000

curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/v1/audio/speech" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"kokoro","input":"Hello world","voice":"zm_010","response_format":"wav"}' \
  --output output.wav
```

When `KOKORO_API_KEY` is enabled, add:

```bash
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### MOSS reference-audio clone

MOSS clone does **not** use `models/models--hexgrad--Kokoro-82M-v1.1-zh/voices`. That directory is for Kokoro `.pt` voices.

The recommended path is uploading the reference audio with the request:

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/api/tts" \
  -F model=moss \
  -F text="This is a reference-audio clone test." \
  -F voice=Junhao \
  -F response_format=wav \
  -F prompt_audio=@reference.wav \
  --output clone.wav
```

WebSocket streaming clone carries reference audio in the first JSON message:

```json
{
  "model": "moss",
  "text": "This is a streamed reference-audio clone test.",
  "voice": "Junhao",
  "format": "pcm_s16le",
  "prompt_audio": {
    "filename": "reference.wav",
    "data": "<base64-or-data-url>"
  }
}
```

- [`/api-docs`](http://localhost:8000/api-docs)
- [`docs/API_REFERENCE.md`](docs/API_REFERENCE.md)

## Model files

If local model files are not found, the service falls back to Hugging Face download. For offline deployments or faster cold starts, set `ANGEVOICE_MODEL_SOURCE=offline` only after preparing complete local model assets:

```bash
pipx install huggingface_hub
mkdir -p models/models--hexgrad--Kokoro-82M-v1.1-zh
huggingface-cli download hexgrad/Kokoro-82M-v1.1-zh \
  --local-dir models/models--hexgrad--Kokoro-82M-v1.1-zh \
  --include "config.json" "kokoro-v1_1-zh.pth" "voices/*.pt"
```

Recommended unified model layout:

```text
models/
├── models--hexgrad--Kokoro-82M-v1.1-zh/
│   ├── config.json
│   ├── kokoro-v1_1-zh.pth
│   └── voices/*.pt
├── MOSS-TTS-Nano-100M-ONNX/
└── modelscope-cache/
```

A normal `git clone` or GitHub source archive may only include Git LFS pointer files. AngeVoice validates both the Kokoro main model and voice files, skips LFS pointers, HTML/JSON error pages, and incomplete files, and avoids passing those text placeholders to `torch.load`. Kokoro voice files can be much smaller than the main model, so validation now checks file signatures first and no longer spams logs for the same 131-byte LFS pointer during long synthesis.

## Docker persistence

| Host path | Container path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `../../models` | `/app/models` | Unified model directory for Kokoro, Hugging Face cache, ModelScope cache, and MOSS ONNX assets |
| `../../outputs` | `/app/outputs` | HTTP synthesis outputs when `ANGEVOICE_SAVE_OUTPUTS=true` |

To set a server-side default MOSS reference audio:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ../../prompts:/app/prompts:ro

environment:
  - MOSS_PROMPT_AUDIO_PATH=/app/prompts/reference.wav
```

## Security notes

- Docker/fnOS templates default to `KOKORO_API_KEY=auto` and enable basic HTTP/WebSocket entry guards. Leaving the API key empty remains supported only for trusted local/source deployments; do not expose that mode publicly.
- Docker templates provide `admin / admin123` for first entry so users can obtain the API key. Change the credentials before public exposure; changed passwords are stored only as hashes. Restrict `/admin` at the reverse proxy.
- `.pt` voice upload is disabled by default. Only upload trusted files.

⚠️ **Security Warning**: Enabling `KOKORO_VOICE_UPLOAD_ENABLED` on public-facing servers is **strongly discouraged**.
Only upload `.pt` files you generated yourself or from fully trusted sources.
If upload must be enabled, restrict to internal network admin endpoints with reverse-proxy IP whitelisting.
`.pt` files use PyTorch serialization which can theoretically execute arbitrary code.
- Do not expose `/admin/*` directly to the public internet.

See [`docs/SECURITY.md`](docs/SECURITY.md).

## Known limitations

- AngeVoice does not train a new model; quality, license, and language capability follow upstream models.
- Kokoro, MOSS-TTS-Nano and ZipVoice Docker/fnOS templates enable killable isolated workers by default. Startup preload is off, so the first request shows a wake/load state. If isolation is disabled, VRAM may be released on a best-effort basis but host RAM is not guaranteed to return to a cold-start baseline.
- The optional full cleanup after idle unload is disabled by default. It only exits after an idle unload succeeds; use it with `restart: unless-stopped`, `restart: always`, or an equivalent service manager policy.
- MOSS runtime provider status is reported separately from its product name. Legacy request IDs `moss-nano-cpu` / `moss-nano-cuda` remain accepted only for compatibility. Keep the standard `gpu` path evidence-based on the target host before long-running service.
- Long-form text is synthesized segment by segment. Very long books should use a batch/task workflow.
- For GPU deployments, avoid multiple workers loading the model at the same time unless you have enough VRAM.
- MP3 output depends on ffmpeg.
- WebSocket streaming sends bounded audio chunks, not token-level speech generation.

## Testing

```bash
uv pip install -e '.[dev]'
pytest -q --cov=kokoro_tts --cov-report=term-missing
```

End-to-end testing (requires a running service):

```bash
# Full E2E loop test: health / voices / synthesis / websocket / cancel / idle unload / stress
chmod +x scripts/e2e_loop_test.sh
./scripts/e2e_loop_test.sh http://127.0.0.1:8101              # no auth, 10 loops
./scripts/e2e_loop_test.sh http://127.0.0.1:8101 my-key 50    # with auth, 50 loops
```

Lightweight smoke tests:

You can also manually trigger the `Docker CPU Smoke` GitHub Actions workflow to validate `docker compose config --quiet`, CPU image build, container startup, `/health`, and `scripts/smoke_test.sh`.

```bash
chmod +x scripts/smoke_test.sh scripts/loop_test.sh
BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8101 ./scripts/smoke_test.sh
N=50 BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8101 ./scripts/loop_test.sh
```
